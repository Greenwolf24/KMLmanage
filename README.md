# KMLmanage
A bruteforce method of creating KML files

The plan for this project is to make a simple library to create simple KML files
The reason for me making this is because I wanted to be able to create KML paths for Google Earth, but CSVs won't make paths, just points
The method I will use will basically be partially reverse-engineer, partially brute force to make a new KML file for a path of points.

While I only currently plan on using this for path creation, I do plan on expanding on it if I ever need to for other projects.
